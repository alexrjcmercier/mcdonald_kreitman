# mcdonald_kreitman_test
Python script to run a McDonald-Kreitman test on one or a set of genes (one .fasta multi-alignment file per gene) inside a provided folder.

/!\ beware, this script is the very first project python I've worked on, and as such is quite old and dirty.
To ensure it's reliability, I tested its results for multiple gene sequences against the results obtained with the MKT calculator availablme here: http://mkt.uab.es/mkt/help_mkt.asp (Egea et al. 2008) and had complete consistency.

Inscructions are commented line 2 of the script.
