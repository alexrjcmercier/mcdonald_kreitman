# mcdonald_kreitman
/!\ beware, this script is the very first project python I've worked on, and as such is really old and dirty code. It works though.

Python script to run a McDonald-Kreitman test on one or a set of genes (one .fasta multi-alignment file per gene) inside a provided folder.
Inscructions are commented line 2 of the script.
